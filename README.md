# Soledad
This is my first game and my submision for the GMTK Jam 2020.

This is a personal take on Alzheimer disease. Soledad is a grand-mother with Alzheimer. I imagine her family members talking to her about someone and her trying to remember who they are.

If you are quick, the memories remain. But Alzheimer is relentless and no matter how much you try, she will start forgetting...

In the end, the relationships fade until there is no one else in her mind, but herself...
